## Hi 👋 I’m Trang

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** in Quebec, Canada with a background in **International Business**.

I’m building my fundamentals from the ground up and focusing on **how and why code works**. 

My main tech stack is javascript, react and tailwind/bootstrap. I will master Typescript in the near future!

I have many projects, but my favorite one so far is Dotlity.

I care about:
- clean, understandable code  
- finishing projects end-to-end  
- finding and fixing bugs

Actively improving my **technical French** for the Quebec job market.

⚡ **Fun Facts**:
- I don't like crunchy food
- I can't swim, but love sea and ocean animal, so I compromised and visit aquariums alot. XD
- Hobbies: anime, co-op video games, have random application ideas and try to build them
